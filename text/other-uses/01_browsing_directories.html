<h3 id="browsing-directories">Browsing Directories</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to see the contents of a directory, perhaps so as to select a file
to edit. For instance, if working on a project comprising multiple files you
want to see a list of the files in a separate window.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Invoke Vim with a directory name as an argument, e.g. <tt>vim
~/projects/flying-pigs/</tt>. From within Vim use the <tt>:Ex</tt>
(mnemonic: <i>Ex</i>plore) command. By default it shows the contents of the
current file's directory, but you can provide a directory name if you wish.
For example: <tt>:Ex ~/projects/flying-pigs</tt>. The directory is shown
in a split screen if the current file has been modified.</p>

<p>To force a directory listing in a split pane, so you can view a file and
its directory listing at once, use <tt>:Sex</tt><span class="fn">No,
that's not a joke; the concept is synonymous with Vim</span>. Similarly,
<tt>:Vex</tt> to browse in a vertical split, and <tt>:Tex</tt> to
browse in a new tab.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>By default Vim lists every file contained in a directory. To get a more
<tt>ls</tt>-style listing you can specify a hiding list with <tt>:let
  g:netrw_listhide='\^\..*'</tt>. (This is a comma-separated list of regular
expressions).  When you're browsing a directory files starting with a period
will now be hidden. <span class="fn">By Unix/Linux convention filenames which
  begin with a period are designated hidden. By default file browsers and
  other utilities ignore these files unless explicitly commanded not
  to.</span> If you hit <kbd>a</kbd> once you'll invert the hiding list
(showing only hidden files).  If you hit <kbd>a</kbd> again you'll remove the
hiding list, showing everything.</p>

<p>To change how directory entries are sorted you can modify the
<tt>g:netrw_sort_sequence</tt> variable. By default its value is, deep
breath:</p>

<pre><code>
[\/]$,\.h$,\.c$,\.cpp$,*,\.o$,\.obj$,\.info$,\.swp$,\.bak$,\~$
</code></pre>

<p>The order of the patterns is the order of the sort. For instance, the first
pattern matches directories, so they're shown first. The next pattern matches
file names ending with <tt>*.h</tt> (C header files), so they're shown next.
And so on. The <tt>*</tt> pattern matches everything not matched by the other
patterns. You can change this pattern on-the-fly by hitting <kbd>S</kbd> while
viewing a directory listing.</p>

<p>You can change into a directory by selecting it and hitting
<kbd>Enter</kbd>. The same thing works for files. If you'd rather open a file
in a new buffer use <kbd>p</kbd>. <kbd>P</kbd> will open the file in a split
screen.</p>
