<h3 id="working-with-remote-files">Working with Remote Files</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to edit/view a file that is stored on another computer.</p>

<p>For example, you might want to change a file on your website from your home
computer. Or, you want to change the <i>message of the day</i> file on a
server you administer.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>To invoke Vim with a remote file use its URL as the argument to
<tt>vim</tt>.  For example: <tt>vim
  sftp://guest@example.com/file.txt</tt>.</p>

<p>To work with remote files from within Vim, just use their URLs in place of
a filename with normal editing commands.</p>

<p>So, to to open a remote file for editing use <tt>:e <var>URL</var></tt>.
For example: <tt>:e ftp://user@example.com/README</tt>.</p>

<p>To save to a remote file use <tt>:w <var>URL</var></tt>. For example:
<tt>:w scp://kci@jojo.example.com/etc/motd</tt>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>Vim supports the following protocols: <abbr title="Secure Copy
  Protocol">SCP</abbr>, <abbr title="Secure File Transfer
  Protocol">SFTP</abbr>, <abbr title="Remote Copy Protocol">RCP</abbr>, <abbr
  title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> (read-only), <abbr
  title="Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning">WebDAV</abbr>,
<i>rsync</i> (read-only), and <i>fetch</i> (read-only). However, it relies on
external programs to do so.  On Linux, most of these programs are available by
default; on Windows, for example, only <abbr title="File Transfer
  Protocol">FTP</abbr> is normally
available. See <tt>:help netrw-externapp</tt> for more information.</p>

<p>If the protocol requires authentication, you can supply the username as
part of the URL, and then be prompted for the password interactively. This
gets boring fast, however. </p>

<p>If you're editing files via <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> or <abbr
  title="Secure Copy Protocol">SCP</abbr> consider setting up <i>passwordless
  logins</i>. The principle is explained in <a
  href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/152">Password-less
  logins with OpenSSH</a> for <i>Debian Linux</i>, but it is much for the same
for other operating systems.</p>

<p>If you're using FTP on Linux, you can store your credentials in
<tt>~/.netrc'</tt>. The file is formatted as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>machine {host name 1}
         login {username}
         password {password}

 machine {host name 2}
...</code></pre>

<p>It should be made read-only for your user: <tt>chmod 600 ~/.netrc</tt>
<span class="todo">Windows explanation?</span>.  Now you can use URLs like
<i>ftp://example.org/README</i>, and it will find your username and password
automatically.</p>

<blockquote class="warning">
  <p>&#x26A0; FTP is an insecure protocol, so please don't use it unless you must.
  SSH/SFTP/SCP are all superior alternatives.</p>
