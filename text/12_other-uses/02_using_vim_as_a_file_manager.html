<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to use Vim to manage your file system in a similar way to
<i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Midnight Commander</i>, or <i>Windows Explorer</i>.</p>

<p>For example, you want to rename files matching a certain pattern. Or you
want to compress the contents of a directory.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p><a href="#browsing-directories">Browsing Directories</a> explains the
basics of working with directories in Vim, so read it first.</p>

<blockquote class="callout">

  <h5>Marking Files</h5>

  <p>To operate on files you must first <i>mark</i> them (this does not have
  any relation to the <a href="#navigating-marks"><i>marks</i>
    feature</a>).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Mark</b> the file under the cursor: <kbd>mf</kbd> (mnemonic:
    <i>m</i>ark <i>f</i>ile).</li>
    <li><b>Unmark</b> the marked file under the cursor: <kbd>mf</kbd>.</li>
    <li>Mark files <b>matching a Vim regular expression</b>: <kbd>mr</kbd>
    (mnemonic: <i>m</i>ark with <i>r</i>egular expression). You're then
    prompted for a <a href="#creating-regular-expressions">pattern</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Unmark all</b> files: <kbd>mu</kbd> (mnemonic: <i>m</i>arks
    <i>u</i>ndo).</li>
    <li><b>Visually</b> mark files:
    <kbd><kbd>&lt;Shift&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>v</kbd></kbd>, then <kbd>j</kbd> and
    <kbd>k</kbd> to change the selection area.</li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>

<p>You can operate on a single file or a group of them. In the latter case,
you need to select files by marking them, as explained in the sidebar. You can
now perform various operations on these files such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Deletion</b>: hit <kbd>D</kbd>. You're prompted for each file you've
  selected. Answering <kbd>a</kbd> deletes them all without asking you any
  more.</li>
  <li><b>Renaming</b>: hit <kbd>R</kbd>. For each file you're prompted for its
  new name.</li>
  <li><b>Copying/Moving</b>: Hit <kbd>mt</kbd> (mnemonic: <i>m</i>ark
  <i>t</i>arget) in the target directory. Change to the directory containing
  the source files, select them, then hit <kbd>mc</kbd> (mnemonic: <i>m</i>arked
  <i>c</i>opy) to copy or <kbd>mm</kbd> (mnemonic: <i>m</i>arked
  <i>m</i>ove) to move.</li>
  <li><b>Diff</b>: To <a href="#viewing-differences-between-files">diff</a> up
  to three marked files, use <kbd>md</kbd> (mnemonic: <i>m</i>arked
  <i>d</i>iff).</li>
  <li><b>Printing</b>: hit <kbd>mp</kbd> to print marked files (mnemonic:
  <i>m</i>ark <i>p</i>rint).</li>
  <li><b>Execute shell command</b>: hit <kbd>mx</kbd> (mnemonic:
  <i>m</i>arked e<i>x</i>ecute). (See the discussion for examples).</li>
  <li><b>Compress/Decompress</b>: hit <kbd>mz</kbd> (mnemonic: <i>m</i>arked
  g<i>z</i>ip). (Other compression utilities can be used instead of
  <tt>gzip</tt>, but the Vim command remains the same).</li>
  <li><b>Open</b> in horizontal split: hit <kbd>o</kbd> (mnemonic:
  <i>o</i>pen).</li>
</ul>


<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>Vim can be used as a pretty well-featured file manager. In fact, given that
it can be scripted, key mapped, and configured in concert with Vim, as well as
seamlessly operate on remote directories, it is arguably better.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting command is <kbd>mx</kbd>. This allows you to
pass the list of marked files to an external command. You're prompted for a
command line, in which you can use the <tt>%</tt> wildcard. Vim then loops
through the selected files and calls the command for each one, substituting
<tt>%</tt> for the filename. </p>

<p>For example, using a POSIX-compatible system, select three files
(<tt>foo.txt</tt>, <tt>bar.txt</tt>, and <tt>glark</tt>) with <kbd>mf</kbd>.
Hit <kbd>mx</kbd> and enter <tt>cat %&gt;&gt;foo-bar-glark</tt>. Vim will now
execute:</p>

<pre><code>cat foo.txt &gt;&gt;foo-bar-glark
cat bar.txt &gt;&gt;foo-bar-glark
cat glark &gt;&gt;foo-bar-glark</code></pre>

<p><tt>foo-bar-glark</tt> will now contain the contents of each file in turn.</p>

<p>The <kbd>mz</kbd> command also bears further discussion. It toggles the
state of the selected files between compressed and decompressed. </p>

<p>If a file is uncompressed, Vim attempts to compress it. By default it uses
<tt>gzip</tt>, but you can change this by modifying the
<tt>g:netrw_compress</tt> variable. For example, to use Bzip2: <tt>:let
  g:netrw_compress=bzip2</tt>.</p>

<p>For decompression Vim uses an extension-to-program mapping:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>.tar</tt> - <tt>tar -xf</tt></li>
  <li><tt>.gz</tt> - <tt>gunzip</tt></li>
  <li><tt>.bz2</tt> - <tt>bunzip2</tt></li>
  <li><tt>.zip</tt> - <tt>unzip</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if a filename ends with <tt>.zip</tt> Vim decompresses it by
calling <tt>unzip <var>zip-file</var></tt>. To add support for another format
use <tt>:let g:netrw_decompress[<var>ext</var>] = <var>prog</var></tt>.</p>
