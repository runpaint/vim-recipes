<h3 id="inserting-snippets">Inserting Snippets</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You repeatedly type the same constructs, so want to expedite the process by
typing a few letters then have Vim produce the boilerplate text.</p>

<p>For example, to enter a HTML <tt>&lt;table&gt;</tt> you want to type
<tt>table<kbd><kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd></kbd></tt> then have Vim produce:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table border=" "&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;h&gt; &lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Use Michael Sanders' <a
  href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540">snipMate</a>
plugin.</p>

<p>Follow the installation instructions on the script page, then open up a
HTML document with Vim, e.g. <tt>vim test.html</tt>. Type
<tt>table<kbd><kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd></kbd></tt>. The <tt>&lt;table&gt;</tt>
given above should be inserted into your document.</p>

<p>In the above example, <i>table</i> is the <i>trigger</i>, the text you
type, and the resultant HTML is the <i>snippet</i>, the text that is inserted
after typing <tt><var>trigger</var><kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd></tt>.</p>

<p><i>snipMate</i> is distributed with a collection of snippets for common
file types. To see a list of snippets available for the current buffer execute
<tt><kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>R</kbd>
    <kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd></kbd></tt>. To write your own, see <tt>:help
  snipMate</tt>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>The power of <i>snipMate</i> comes from how it lets you navigate the
snippet once inserted. Consider again the <tt>&lt;table&gt;</tt> example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table border="<var>1</var>"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;<var>2</var>&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;h&gt;<var>3</var>&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;<var>4</var></code></pre>

<p>The numbers, e.g. <var>1</var>, in the above output represent <i>tab
  stops</i>: the positions where the <var>n</var><sup>th</sup>
<kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd> after the trigger will move the cursor to. So, the user
types <tt>table<kbd><kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd></kbd></tt> to insert the snippet.
His cursor is placed in position <var>1</var> so he can enter the border size.
He then hits <kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd> again to position his cursor in
<var>2</var> so he can enter the name of the header for the first row. And so
on.</p>  

<p>Some constructs require user-entered text to appear multiple times. For
instance, HTML authors may want to enter an <tt>&lt;option&gt;</tt> element
like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;option value="<var>placeholder</var>"&gt;<var>placeholder</var>&lt;/option&gt;</code></pre>

<p>In this example, <var>placeholder</var> is placeholder text that needs to be
entered twice. <i>snipMate</i> lets you enter the text in
<tt>value="<var>placeholder</var>"&gt;</tt>, and have it copied into
&gt;<var>placeholder</var>&lt; as you type.</p>

  <h5>Comparison of Techniques to Auto-Complete Text</h5>

  <p>We have discussed various approaches to automatically inserting text in this
  chapter, so let us recap<span class="fn">The forthcoming is intentionally
    opinionated and simplified because a detailed analysis of every possibility is
    beyond the scope of this book. That said, if there are any factual errors,
    please let me know.</span>.</p>  

  <p><a href="#using-templates">Templates</a> can be used to associate a skeleton
  document with a file extension, whereby opening a file whose name ends with
  that extension causes the skeleton document to be inserted into the buffer.
  The advantage of this approach is that it doesn't require the installation of
  any plugins, but other than that <i>snipMate</i> can be used to achieve the
  same effect. For example, <i>SnipMate</i> has a trigger named <i>docx</i>
  which inserts the XHTML 1.1 doctype:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd"&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>This can trivially be adapted to insert whatever boilerplate HTML you
  desire.</p>

  <p><a href="abbreviating-common-strngs">Abbreviations</a> can be used to
  replace a piece of text with another piece of text after pressing
  <kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd>. They differ from snippets in two key respects.
  Abbreviations are typically defined globally, whereas snippets are defined
  for specific filetypes. For instance, a trigger of <tt>for</tt> could insert
  a C <i>for</i> loop when editing C source code, or a Ruby <i>for</i> loop
  when editing Ruby code. More importantly, snippets have the notion of
  placeholders that can be tabbed between. In general, snippets can do
  everything abbreviations can, and more.</p>  

  <p><a href="#auto-completing-text">Insert-mode auto-completion</a> can
  auto-complete text based on what has already been typed or the grammar of
  the current file type. For instance, you can auto-complete a variable name
  that you have declared previously, or a language keyword. This form of
  auto-completion augments <i>snipMate</i>: use the former to complete unique
  definitions and names in the current file, and those that it includes; use
  the latter to complete pre-defined snippets.  Where the two's
  functionalities overlap, <i>snipMate</i> has a simpler interface (type a
  trigger, hit <kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd>), and is, arguably, easier to
  configure.</p>
