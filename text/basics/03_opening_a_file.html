<h3 id="opening-files">Opening Files</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to open a file in Vim.</p>

<p>If you want to edit or view an existing file you need to open it first. For
example, if your world-changing novel is saved as <tt>novel.txt</tt>, you want to
open <tt>novel.txt</tt> in Vim.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>To open a file from the command line invoke Vim with the filename as an
argument. For example: <tt>vim docs/novel.txt</tt> (on Windows:
<tt>vim.exe docs\novel.txt</tt>).</p>

<p>To open a file from inside Vim you can use <code>:e <var>file</var></code>
(mnemonic: <b>e</b>dit).  This closes the current file and opens a new buffer
containing the given file. </p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>You may prefix the filename with <tt>+<var>linenumber</var> </tt> to
instruct Vim to jump to the given line after opening. For example, <tt>vim +7
  todo.list</tt> or <tt>:e +100 treatise.txt</tt>. If you omit
<var>linenumber</var>, i.e. you prefix the filename with <tt>+</tt>, Vim will
jump to the end of the file.</p>

<p>Similarly, prefixing the filename with <tt>+/<var>pattern</var></tt>
positions the cursor at the first occurrence of the <a
  href="#creating-regular-expressions">pattern</a> <var>pattern</var>. For
example, <tt>vim +/^References btrees.textile</tt> instructs Vim to open
<tt>btrees.textile</tt>, find the first line that starts with
<em>References</em>, then position the cursor there.  </p>

<blockquote class="tip"> 
  The <tt>:cd <var>directory</var></tt> command lets
  you change the directory Vim resolves relative paths to. So if you're
  working with multiple files in the same directory tree you can use this
  command to set your working directory so it's easier to open files. For
  example, instead of opening <tt>/home/julie/recipes/pasta/cabonara.txt</tt>
  then <tt>/home/julie/recipes/pasta/peperonata.txt</tt> you can <tt>:cd
    /home/julie/recipes/pasta</tt> then <tt>:e carbonara.txt</tt>. If you
  forget which directory you're in <tt>:pwd</tt> (<b>p</b>rint <b>w</b>orking
  <b>d</b>irectory) will tell you.  
</blockquote>

<p>If you supply multiple filenames, Vim opens them all, one in each <a
  href="#navigating-buffers">buffer</a>. The first file named is opened in the
current buffer. If you provide a line number or pattern to jump to, this only
affects the first named file. Typing <tt>:next</tt> advances you to the next
file in the list.</p>

<p>When working with multiple files you may prefer to view them in tabs or
split windows, instead of buffers. </p>

<p><a href="#navigating-tabs">Tabs</a> display a single file at a time, but,
by default, provide a list of opened tabs across the top of the screen. You
can switch to an open tab by clicking on its name in the GUI or referring to
its number. From within Vim <tt>:tabedit <var>file</var></tt> opens the named
file in a new tab. Or, from the command line <tt>vim -p
  <var>files</var></tt> opens each named file in its own tab.</p>

<p><a href="#splitting-the-screen">Split windows</a> display multiple files on
screen simultenously. By default the screen is divided horizontally, putting
each file beneath the previous, but you may also split it vertically so that
each file is displayed next to each other.  From Vim <tt>:split
  <var>file</var></tt> splits the screen horizontally between the current file
and the named file. <tt>:vsplit <var>file</var></tt> effects a vertical
division. These operations can be conducted from the command line with <tt>vim
  -o <var>files</var></tt> and <tt>vim -O <var>files</var></tt>,
respectively.</p>

<p>So far we have specified filenames literally by naming each file to open.
However, at other times this is impractical. For example, suppose you want to
edit all files whose names end with <tt>.txt</tt>, or a file that you can only
remember has the word <tt>lethargy</tt> in it. In cases such as these we would
rather describe a group of files by using wildcards.</p>

<p>If you're opening a file from the command line (i.e. <tt>vim
  resume.tex</tt>), your shell expands any wildcards. Windows is notoriously
weak at command-line work, but other operating systems will probably do the
right thing here. For example, using the <em>bash</em> shell I can open
<tt>.txt</tt> files whose names start with <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>, or
<tt>3</tt> with <tt>vim [123]*.txt</tt>.</p>

<p>Vim commands that accept filenames support a <i>similar</i> set of
wildcards with one caveat: some commands only accept a single filename, while
others accept a list. The implication is that if you use wildcards with a
command like <tt>:edit</tt>, which only takes a single filename, they cannot
expand to multiple files. So if your current directory contained only one
<tt>.html</tt> file, <tt>:edit *.html</tt> would save you typing and work how
you expect. However, if the directory contained multiple <tt>.html</tt> files,
that same wildcard would imply a list of files, and <tt>:edit *.html</tt>
would complain: <samp>E77: Too many file names</samp>.</p>

<p>Instead of using <tt>:edit</tt>, you can use <tt>:next
  <var>files</var></tt> which happily accepts a list of files, and opens each
one in a new buffer. The <tt>:args <var>files</var></tt> command is similar,
but instead of appending the list of files to the current list of open files,
it uses them to replace the current list.</p>
