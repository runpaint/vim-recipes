<h3 id="navigating-tags">Navigating Tags</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You're working on a project where you need to jump between occurrences of
significant keywords, which are possibly spread across multiple files.</p>

<p>For example, you're writing source code and want to be able to type a
function name then quickly jump to where it was initially defined so you
understand how it should be used. Then you want to return to where you
were.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Use <i>tags</i>. Tags are similar to index entries in a book: significant
terms are linked to the key places that they occur. </p>

<p>We will use a program called <a
  href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/"><i>Exuberant Ctags</i></a> to generate
the tag list because it is compatible with all popular programming languages:
C, assembler, ASP, Bourne/Korn/Z shell, C++, COBOL, Eiffel, Fortran, Java,
Lisp, Lua, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, REXX, Ruby, S-Lang, Scheme, Tcl,
Verilog, Vim and YACC.</p>

<p>After you have installed Ctags you can generate a tag list for the current
directory (and its sub-directories) with <tt>ctags -R</tt>. To only consider
files in the current directory use <tt>ctags *</tt>.  This will generate a tag
list for source code in most common languages.</p>

<p>You can now open a source file from that directory and use the <tt>:tag
  <var>tag</var></tt> command to jump to the definition of the tag. To look up
the tag under the cursor use <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd></kbd>.
You can also auto-complete tag names by starting to type one then using
<kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd> to cycle through the list of matching tags. To return
to where you were before you jumped to a
tag you use <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd></kbd>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>So far, we have only described tags in terms of program source code, but
they are by no means limited to this domain. The Vim help system uses tags
extensively to allow navigation. When you use <tt>:help <var>term</var></tt>
you're actually looking up a tag in the documentation tag file. When you
position your cursor over a highlighted entry in a help file, you use
<kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd></kbd> to follow it. This is all
possible because as long as you have a way of identifying significant terms in
a file, you can generate a tags list for it. For example, here's an excerpt
from the tags documentation:</p>

<pre>
                *tags-option*
The 'tags' option is a list of file names.  Each of these
files is searched for the tag.  This can be used to use a
different tags file than the default file "tags".  It can
also be used to access a common tags file.
</pre>

<p>The <tt>tags-option</tt> syntax is used for defining a tag.  Elsewhere, the
<tt>|tags-option|</tt> syntax is used for linking to a tag. You can use
<tt>:helptags <var>dir</var></tt> for generating a taglist for all
<tt>*.txt</tt> files in the given directory which are marked up in this
way.</p>

<p>However you generate it, the tag list is a static file, so it must be
regenerated when your files change significantly. In programming projects, it
is typical to update the tags file during the build process. For example, the
<tt>Makefile</tt> could execute <tt>ctags</tt>.</p>

<p>Both invocations of <tt>ctags</tt> given above are very liberal in what
they index.  They search for all programming language source code in the
specified directories, and incorporate all the tags found therein into a
single tags file. To limit <tt>ctags</tt> to just Ruby source code, for
example, you can use <tt>ctags *.rb</tt>. For more control over what files
<tt>ctags</tt> considers, consult its documentation. On Linux: <tt>man
  ctags</tt>.</p>

<p>Once you have generated the tags file Vim needs to be able to find it. By
default it looks for a file named <tt>tags</tt> in the current directory, but
for projects which span multiple directories this is not always suitable. You
can specify the location of the tags file using <tt>:set
  tags=<var>file</var></tt>.  Specify multiple tag files by separating the
paths with commas.  Instruct Vim to search for a tags file recursively with
<tt>:set tags=./tags;/</tt>.</p>

<p>Using <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd></kbd> to jump to a new tag
takes you to a new buffer to show the results. If you'd rather see them in a
new window use <kbd><kbd>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd></kbd>,
or <tt>:stag
  <var>tag</var></tt>. </p>

<p>If you get dizzy after all this jumping around you can reacquaint yourself
with where you've been by using the <tt>:tags</tt> command. This shows you
which tags you've jumped to, and where you jumped to them from.</p>
