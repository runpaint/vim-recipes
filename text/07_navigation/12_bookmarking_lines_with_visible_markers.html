  Markers (<i>Signs</i>)</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

<p>You want to assign visible marks to the margins of certain lines.</p>

<p>For example, you're using Vim as an <abbr title="Integrated Development
  Environment">IDE</abbr> and want breakpoints to be clearly marked. Or, you
want to label lines in need of editing with a question mark icon.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>Vim allows you to define a <i>sign</i> and then associate it with one or
more lines of a file. It is displayed in the right-hand margin as a
two-character string in the terminal, and an icon in Gvim.</p>

<p>Before you use a sign you must define it. For example: </p>

<pre><code>
:sign define fixme text=!! linehl=Todo texthl=Error icon=/path/to/todo.xpm
</code></pre>

<p>Let's break this down. We name the sign <i>fixme</i>, which is how we'll
refer to it later. We specify that in the terminal the sign should be
displayed as <i>!!</i>, and that in the GUI the icon stored at
<tt>/path/to/todo.xpm</tt> should be used instead. The <i>linehl</i> argument
defines the highlight group used for the entire line the sign is attached to;
<i>texthl</i> defines the <a href="#defining-highlight-group">highlight
  group</a> for the sign itself.</p>

<p>Now the sign is defined, presumably in <a
  href="#configuring-vim"><tt>vimrc</tt></a>, you can use it
  in any file. To attach the sign to a specific line you use:</p>

<pre><code>
:sign place <var>id</var> line=<var>line</var> name=<var>name</var>
file=<var>file-path</var>
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>
:sign place 22 line=200 name=fixme file=/home/user/novel.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The <var>id</var> is arbitrary, but must be unique and numeric. The
<var>name</var> is the same name you used when you defined the sign. The value
of the <var>line</var> argument is the number of the line on which the sign
should be attached. The <var>file</var> argument is the full path (no
expansion is done) to a currently loaded file to which the sign should be
attached. So, in the above example, two exclamation marks are inserted in the
margin of the 200<sup>th</sup> line of <tt>/home/user/novel.txt</tt>.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>You only need to define signs once, so that's easy enough, but the syntax
for placing signs is particularly unwieldy.  Let's look at some alternative
approaches.</p>

<p>You could place the following stanza in your <tt>vimrc</tt> so
<kbd>&lt;F5&gt;</kbd> places the previously defined <i>fixme</i> sign on the
current line of the current file:</p>

<pre><code>
function! SignFixme()
  execute(":sign place ".line(".")." line=".line(".")." name=fixme file=".expand("%:p"))
endfunction
map &lt;F5&gt; :call SignFixme()&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than placing signs manually, you may prefer to have them
automatically placed on lines satisfying some criteria. The following stanza
attaches the <i>fixme</i> sign to lines containing notes like <i>TODO: check
  for race conditions</i>. It operates on the current line or selection. So,
you can select a range of lines, press <kbd>&lt;F6&gt;</kbd> then have your
to-do list items flagged in the margin.</p>

<pre><code>
function! SignLines() range
  let n = a:firstline
  execute(":sign define fixme text=!! texthl=Todo")
  while n &lt;= a:lastline
    if getline(n) =~ '\(TODO\|FIXME\)'
      execute(":sign place ".n." line=".n." name=fixme file=".expand("%:p"))
    endif
    let n = n + 1
  endwhile  
endfunction
map &lt;F6&gt; :call SignLines()&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>
